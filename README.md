# R-Supervised-Methods

In this repository, I explore the __heart diseases__ dataset from University of California, Irvine (UCI). After the exploration, I analyze the variables and try to find the relevant features with methods like PCA. After that, I train and evaluate the next supervised models:
 - Stochastic Gradient Boosting
 - Neural Network
 - Random Forest
 
 The project has been developed in R language.
